Planet X05-07LJL has sought the help of the International Space Department to regain control of their commercial servers by the HOF Galatic Hackers. However, to fix it, we need to replicate the method used to hack the software and retrieve the flag.txt which contains the master key to their servers. After initial reconnaissance, we have retrieved a template of the format for you to use. Save PlanetX05-07LJL's economy.
