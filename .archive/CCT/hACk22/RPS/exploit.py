'''
looks like we have all securities enabled which is fairly annoying
couldnt find the vuln until lucas told me it was array oob (havent looked at exploit script yet)
never actually done array oob exploit except in an assembly intro course
he also said you need to win 5 times so will try to understand how that works
any BOF will only crash the program at return, which is all the way at the end of main (see source code)
and the program restarts before that if you dont win more than 5 times
